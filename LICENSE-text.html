License

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE
COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY
COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS
AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE
BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE
CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE
IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

    "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other
    pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work,
    arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work,
    or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or
    any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted
    including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that
    a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation
    for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the
    Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of
    the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be
    considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.  "Collection"
    means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias
    and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works
    or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by
    reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute
    intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in
    unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each
    constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together
    are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a
    Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined below) for the
    purposes of this License.  "Creative Commons Compatible License" means a
    license that is listed at http://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses
    that has been approved by Creative Commons as being essentially equivalent
    to this License, including, at a minimum, because that license: (i)
    contains terms that have the same purpose, meaning and effect as the
    License Elements of this License; and, (ii) explicitly permits the
    relicensing of adaptations of works made available under that license
    under this License or a Creative Commons jurisdiction license with the
    same License Elements as this License.  "Distribute" means to make
    available to the public the original and copies of the Work or Adaptation,
    as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership.  "License
    Elements" means the following high-level license attributes as selected by
    Licensor and indicated in the title of this License: Attribution,
    ShareAlike.  "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or
    entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.
    "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the
    individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no
    individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i)
    in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and
    other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or
    otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore;
    (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal
    entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and,
    (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the
    broadcast.  "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under
    the terms of this License including without limitation any production in
    the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or
    form of its expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet
    and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same
    nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or
    entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a
    cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process
    analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture,
    sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are
    assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work
    of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional
    work relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a
    performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent
    it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety
    or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a
    literary or artistic work.  "You" means an individual or entity exercising
    rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of
    this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express
    permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite
    a previous violation.  "Publicly Perform" means to perform public
    recitations of the Work and to communicate to the public those public
    recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or wireless means
    or public digital performances; to make available to the public Works in
    such a way that members of the public may access these Works from a place
    and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the
    public by any means or process and the communication to the public of the
    performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to
    broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or
    images.  "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means
    including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right
    of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a
    protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic
    medium.

2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit,
or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or
exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection
under copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual
(for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights
in the Work as stated below:

    to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
    Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;
    to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,
    including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly
    label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the
    original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original
    work was translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could
    indicate "The original work has been modified."; to Distribute and
    Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,
    to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.

    For the avoidance of doubt: Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In
    those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any
    statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor
    reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by
    You of the rights granted under this License; Waivable Compulsory License
    Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties
    through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the
    Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any
    exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and, Voluntary
    License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties,
    whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a
    collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that
    society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known
or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such
modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other
media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted
by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

    You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of
    this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
    Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You
    Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on
    the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the
    recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient
    under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must
    keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer
    of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly
    Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not
    impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the
    ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted
    to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a)
    applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not
    require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to
    the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from
    any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
    Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You
    create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the
    extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by
    Section 4(c), as requested.  You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an
    Adaptation only under the terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version
    of this License with the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a
    Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later license
    version) that contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g.,
    Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible
    License. If you license the Adaptation under one of the licenses mentioned
    in (iv), you must comply with the terms of that license. If you license
    the Adaptation under the terms of any of the licenses mentioned in (i),
    (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable License"), you must comply with the terms
    of the Applicable License generally and the following provisions: (I) You
    must include a copy of, or the URI for, the Applicable License with every
    copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You may
    not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of
    the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation
    to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
    Applicable License; (III) You must keep intact all notices that refer to
    the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy
    of the Work as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly
    Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You
    may not impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that
    restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise
    the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable
    License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a
    Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the
    Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable
    License.  If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any
    Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made
    pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work
    and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the
    name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied,
    and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or
    parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for
    attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms
    of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or
    parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent
    reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be
    associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright
    notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with
    Ssection 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use
    of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by
    Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original
    Author"). The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in
    any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation
    or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all
    contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part
    of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for
    the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only
    use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in
    the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this
    License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any
    connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,
    Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of
    the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the
    Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.  Except as otherwise
    agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by
    applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work
    either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must
    not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation
    to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or
    reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in
    which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License
    (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion,
    mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the
    Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not
    assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by
    the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your
    right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but
    not otherwise.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS
THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND
CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER
DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT
OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

    This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
    upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or
    entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this
    License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such
    individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those
    licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of
    this License.  Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license
    granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in
    the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to
    release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the
    Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve
    to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is
    required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License
    will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

    Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the
    Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms
    and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.  Each
    time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to
    the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and
    conditions as the license granted to You under this License.  If any
    provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
    law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder
    of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to
    this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent
    necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.  No term or
    provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented
    to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the
    party to be charged with such waiver or consent.  This License constitutes
    the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed
    here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with
    respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any
    additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This
    License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the
    Licensor and You.  The rights granted under, and the subject matter
    referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the
    Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as
    amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO
    Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of
    1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24,
    1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant
    jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced
    according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those
    treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of
    rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights
    not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be
    included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the
    license of any rights under applicable law.

    Creative Commons Notice

    Creative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty
    whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be
    liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever,
    including without limitation any general, special, incidental or
    consequential damages arising in connection to this
    license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative
    Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it
    shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.

    Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work
    is licensed under the CCPL, Creative Commons does not authorize the use by
    either party of the trademark "Creative Commons" or any related trademark
